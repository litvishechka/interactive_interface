This work was done in Qt Creator 12.0.2 (Community). And corresponds to the following task: At the beginning of the round, the red square is located between two lines, 
the distance between which is equal to the 3rd sides of the square. When you click on the square, the lines move from left
to right with some speed. 
Task: bring the square to the right edge of the playing
field without hitting the line. If you are lucky in the next round, the speed of the lines
increases. If the square touches the moving lines, the game ends.
The rounds played are being counted.
The program interface is presented below,
